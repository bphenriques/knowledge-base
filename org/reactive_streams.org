Components of a Reactive Stream:
- *Publisher*: Publishes data to stream
- *Subscriber*: Consumes data from the stream.
- *Processor*: Acts as both a publisher and a subscriber, obeying the contract for each.
- *Subscription*: Connects a subscriber to a publisher to initiate a message flow.

[[file:./akka_streams.org][Akka Streams]] is built on these concepts but provides a different API (albeit is possible to bridge).
