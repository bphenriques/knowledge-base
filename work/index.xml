Some things are pretty obvious (:
Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user. User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.</description></item><item><title>Tips to live by</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/tips-to-live-by/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/tips-to-live-by/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not about being right nor prove others wrong Corollary 1: if it&amp;rsquo;s wrong but it works, then it&amp;rsquo;s not wrong. Corollary 2: if you&amp;rsquo;re right but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the outcome, then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Corollary 3: if you&amp;rsquo;re right, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, then you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn&amp;rsquo;t, then they&amp;rsquo;re right and you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Corollary 5: if you prove someone&amp;rsquo;s solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better.</description></item></channel></rss>
