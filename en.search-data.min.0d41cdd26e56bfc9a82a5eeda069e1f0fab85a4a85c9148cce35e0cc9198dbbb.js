New Projections are easy in CQRD/ES. New projections are retroactive because we have the fully history.

Otherwise the database may become the bottleneck.\nBetter yet: Each projection in its own Microservice. \\[\\]\\[\\]\\[\\] and maintentance.\nConsistency #  Simple (without ES) has the same consistency as non-CQRS systems. CQRD/ES can have different consistency models for the read or the write models.\nWrite Model #  Strong is often important here because we want that those write be based on the current state. This consistency is usually implemented through locks or sharding in a more reactive way.\nRead Model #  Pure reads are never consistent as they are often working with stale data. These reads do not need strong consistency.\nAvailability #  Write Model #  Due to the higher consistency, availability is lower\nRead Model #  Due to the eventual consistency, we can leverage technicques to increase availability.\nCost #  CQRD/ES is often criticized for being more complex but it can be simpler. Without this, models are more bloated, complex and rigid. CQRD allow smaller models that are easier to modify and understand. Eventual consistency in CQRS can be isolated to where it is necessary.\n More databases to maintain More classes/objects to maintain Support older versions can be challenging Additinoal storage Data duplication may result in desyncs that often solved by rebuilding project - Question: when ?

Performance optimizes response time (latency) while scalability optimizes ability to handle load. Requests per second actually measures both but we do not know which aspect was improved.\nNote Scalability is not the number of requests qwe can handle a in a given period of time (req/sec) but he number of requests itself (load).\nIf x axis is number of requests (Load) and y axis is response time. Improving performance leads to decrease in the y axis. Improving scalability means a shift on the x axis meaning that we can handle more requests with the same response time.\nStill confused as if I improve performance I should free up resources to handle more requests..\nReactive Microservices focus on improving scalability.\nConsistency: #  All members of the system have the same view or state. This does not factors time.\nEventual Consistency #  Guarantees that, in the absence of new updates, all accesses to a specific piece of data will eventually return the most recent data.\nDifferent forms:\n Eventual Consistency Causal Consistency Sequential Conssitency others  E.g., Source control are eventually consistent. All the code reading is potentially out-of-date and a merge operations is relied upon to bring the local state back to speed.\nTODO: Check each one #  Strong Consistency #  An update to a piece of data needs agreement from all nodes before it becomes visible.\nPhysically it is impossible therefore we simulate: Locks that introduce overhead in the form of contention. Now it becomes a single resource which eliminates the distributed nature. Tying the distributed problem to a non-distributed resource.\nTraditionally, monoliths are based around strong consistency.\nEffects of contention #  Definition: Any two things that contend for a single limited resource and only one will win and the other will be forced to wait.\nAs the number of resources disputing for the resource, more time time it will take to finally free up the resources.\n   Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s law\nIn short, contention limits paralelization.\nDefines the maximum improvement gaines by parallel procesing. Improvements from paralelization are limited to the code that can be paralelized. Contention limits such paralism reducing the advantages of the improvements. Does not matter as long as the contention exist.\n     Coherence Delay\nDefinition: Time it takes for synchronization to complete on a distributed systems - My definition following below notes:\nSyncronization is done using crosstalk or gossip - Each system sends messages to each other node informing of any state changes. The time it takes for the cynscronization to complete is called Coeherency Delay.\nIncreasing the number of nodes increases the delay.\n     Gunther\u0026rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law\nIncreasing concurrency can cause negative resutrns due to contention and coherency delay.\nPicks from Amdahl\u0026rsquo;s law. In addition to contention, it accounts for coeherency delay.\nAs the system scales up, the cost to coordinate between nodes exceeds any benefits.\n     Laws of scalability\nBoth these laws demonstrate that linear scalability is almost always unachivable. Such is only possible if the system lieve in total isolation.\n     Reactive Systems\nReduce contention by:\n Isolating locks Eliminating transactions Avoiding blocking operations  Mitigate coherency delays by:\n Embracing Eventual Consistency Building in Autonmy  This allows for higher scalability as we reduce or eliminate these factors.\n  CAP Theorem #  States that a distributed system cannnot provide more than than two of the following:\n Consistency Availability Partition Tolerance  One has to pick one of the following combinations:\n (CP) Consistent and Partition Tolerance (AP) Available and Partition Tolerance.  In practice, they may claim CP/AP except for some edge-cases. It is a balance.\nPartition Tolerance #  The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network.\nThey can occur due to:\n Problems in the network. When a node goes down.  May be short or long lived.\nTwo options:\n (AP) Sacrifice Consistency: Allow writes to both sides of the partition. This require merging the data in order to restore consistency. (CP) Sacrifice Availability: Disabling or terminating on side of the partitions. During this, some or all of your system will be unavailable.  Sharding as a way to have strong consistency #  Limit the scope of the contention and reduce crosstalk. Is applied within the application. It is not the same type of sharding used in some databases, the technique is similar though.\nAllows strong consistency.\nPartitions entities (or Actors) in the domain according to their id.\nGroups of entities are called a shard and each entity only exists in one shard.\nEach shard exists in only one location. This fact eliminates the distributed systems problem.\nThe entity acts as a consistency boundary.\nIn order for this to work, we need to have a coordinator that ensures that traffic for a particular entity is routed to the correct location. The coordinator uses the ID to calculate the appropriate shard.\nAggregate Roots are good candidate for sharding.\nIt is important to have a balanced shards and that requires a good sharding key - UUIDs or hashcodes. Poor key selections will result in hotspots.\nRule of thumb: 10x as many shards as nodes.\nAkka provides this as a means to distribute actors across a cCLuster in a shared setup. Lagom persistent entities levarage akka cluster sharding to distribute the entities across the cluster.\nWhat about resharding? when a system goes down\u0026hellip;\nSharding allows a great caching solution as:\n We can store the cache results after writing to the database Databases is effectively write-only which can speed up things We only consult the cache during reads. Begs the question: How many items and what is the TTL? Well.. it for certain reduces the read on the DB but that is not forever unless we have infinite memory.  Effects #   Does not eliminate contention. It solely isolates to a single entity. The router/coordinator represents a source of contention as well. A shareded system minimizes contention by:  Limiting the amounf of work the router/coordinator performs - By storing where the shard is after asking the coordinator - How to invalidate that cache due to failures? Isolates contention to individual entities    Scalability is doen by distributing the shards over mode machines. Strong consistency is achiaved by isolating operations to a specific entity. Careful choice of shard keys is important to maintain a good scalability.\nFailure #  Sharding sacrifices availability. Once a shard goes down, there will be a period of time where it is unavailable and wil migrate to another node eventually.\nCRDTs provide a availability solution based on async replication #  Conflict-free Replicated Data\nOn the application level.\nHighly available and eventually consistent.\nSpecially designed data type.\nUpdates are applied on one replica and then copied async.\nUdpdates are merged to determine the final state.\nTwo types:\n CvRDT - Convergent Replicated Data Type copy state between replicas. Requires a merge operation that understands how to combine two states. These operations must be: commutative, associative and idempotent. CmRDT - Commutative Replicated Data Types. These copy operations isntead of state.

However, if latency is an issue, they should be in the same region.\nTime #  Should not wait for each other which allows more efficient use of resources. Resources can be freed immediatly, rather than waiting for a request to finish.\nBetween microservices we expect eventual consistency. It improves scalability as total consitency requires central coordination which hindes scalability.\nNOTE: This is discussible. However it may be a implementation details.\nFailure #  Isolate failures and should not cause failure on other systems. I.e., it still is responsive to attend other use-cases.\nIsolation Techniques #  Bulkheading #  Failures are isolated to failure zones. Failures in one service will not propagate to other services. Overall the system remains operation but possibly in a degraded state.\nIn practice it means that that systems that depend on the service that is considered a failure zone, will mark that information or service as unavailable. IMO this is tolerable if the service is non-critical.\nCircuit Breaker #  When a service is under stress we do not want to keep on retrying as it may make things worse.\nWay to avoid overloading a service. They qaurantine a failing service so it can fail fast. Allows the failing service to recover in its time before they fail.\nTypes:\n Closed - Normal Operation Open - Fail fast Half Open - Internally after a timeout will let one request to go through and if it fails, it goes back to Open.  Transitions:\n Closed (normal) -\u0026gt; Trip: Open (Fail Fast) Open (Fail fast) -\u0026gt; Attempt Reset: Half Open Half Open -\u0026gt; Trip: Open (fail Fast) Half Open -\u0026gt; Reset: Closed (Normal)  Message Driven Architecture #   Async and non blocking messages allows decoupling both time and failure. System do not depend on the response from on another. If a request to a service fails, the failure will not propagated. The client service isn\u0026rsquo;t waiting for response. It can continue to operate normally.  Autonomy #  Services can operate independently from each other.\nAutonomous services have enough information to resolve conflicts and repair failures. This means that they do not require other services to be operational all the time. Ideally all the time but in reality for a short time it guarantees some level of autonomy.\nBenefits:\n Stronger scalability and availability. Can be scaled indefinetly. Operate independently.  How:\n Async messages. Maintain enough internal state ofr the microservices to function in isolation. Use eventual consistency. Avoid direct, syncronous dependencies on external services.  API Gateway Services #  Microservices can lead to complexity in the API. How can we manage complex APIs that access many microservices?\nA new microservice that is put between the client and the N-services that are required to fulfill that request. This new microservice is responsible for aggregating the responses moving the responsbility from the client itself. This way, the client only needs to manage failures from the gateway.\nThis effectively creates an additional layer of isolation.\n!! This is specially useful for mobile applicatios where we cannot guarantee that the clients will update their app.\n"});index.add({'id':18,'href':'/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/','title':"Monolith",'section':"System Design",'content':" Referred in:\n Domain Driven Design Service Oriented Architecture   Some notes taken during the lightbend course on Reactive Microservices.
