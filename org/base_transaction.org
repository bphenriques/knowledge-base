Sometimes ACID transactions are not possible in some cases, e.g., microservices. As alternative, we use BASE transactions:
- Basically Available
- Soft State
- Eventual Consistency

The difference from ACID transactions it that they cannot be rolledback easily. To rollback, a compensating action is needed to revert to the original state. Saga manages these kind of transactions and are often used to manage different aggregate roots (see [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578c5][Domain Driven Design]]).
