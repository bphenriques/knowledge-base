* Asserting asynchronous task

Sometimes ~CountdownLatch~ is not possible, leading to ~Thread.sleep(...)~ that is not ideal as it blocks the system longer than required.
As an alternative, follows a snippet that implements a pooling mechanism. Ideally, opt for CountdownLatch.

Better alternatives are welcome.

fun assertWaitFor(timeoutMs: Long = 5000, intervalMs: Long = 250, fn: () -> Unit) {
    val start = Instant.now()
    var lastError: Throwable? = null
    while (Duration.between(start, Instant.now()).toMillis() <= timeoutMs) {
        try {
            fn()
            return
        } catch (ex: AssertionError) {
            lastError = ex
        }
        Thread.sleep(intervalMs)
    }

    fail("Failed to reach expected condition within $timeoutMs ms.", lastError!!)
}
