Lightbend Academy In the context of Reactive Systems, Actor model is a reactive tool, a paradigm that:
Message driven - All communication between actors is done with async non-blocking messages. Abstractions provide elasticity and resiliency. Akka uses the actor model - https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/actors-intro.html?language=scala
Fundamental All computation occurs inside of the actor. Each actor has an address. Actors only communicate through asyncronous messages. The message driven system provides location transparency, i.</description></item><item><title>Apache Spark</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</guid><description>#ROAM_TAGS: data

On Reporting Bugs Focus on the impact for the client. You do not need to debug right away. You do not need to establish the timeline - The report can solely include the context. The person assigned to the issue will pick on the context provided in the ticket and explore.</description></item><item><title>Consistency And Availability</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/consistency_and_availability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/consistency_and_availability/</guid><description>Scalability It can meets increases in demand while remaining responsive.
This is different from performance. Performance optimizes response time (latency) while scalability optimizes ability to handle load. Requests per second actually measures both but we do not know which aspect was improved.
Note Scalability is not the number of requests qwe can handle a in a given period of time (req/sec) but he number of requests itself (load).
If x axis is number of requests (Load) and y axis is response time.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Systems</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/distribute_systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/distribute_systems/</guid><description>Definition: Systems that are separated by space.

Subject-Verb-Object notation Allows having a consistent way to phrase activies our events in the domain.
Example: Host checks current reservation.
Subject: Host Verb: Checks Object: Reservation Note that &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; can be seen as a modifier.

configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES, true) configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false) FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES Setting FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES forces clients to explicitely provide all values including primitives. Consider the following POJO:
data class Foo(bar: Boolean) Without the setting, a payload such as { } would render ~Foo(bar=false)~ despite the lack of default value. Given this, to guarantee consistency between the source-code and the external contract, I advise enabling this.</description></item><item><title>JWT</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/security/jwt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/security/jwt/</guid><description>What it is JSON Web Tokens

Microservices can be physically separated and independently deployed. Each have its own data store. Independent and self governing. Communication is syncronous or asyncronous (e.g., through message brokers). Loose coupling between components (more or less by experience but that is design flaw likely :thinking:). Shorter development and release cycles. Each scale independently (either through physical or virtual machines). Advantages Deployed/Scaled as needed.</description></item><item><title>Monolith</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</guid><description>Referred in
Service Oriented Architecture Some notes taken during the lightbend course on Reactive Microservices. Some of these ideas are familiar as they are intuitive.
Deployed as a single unit. No Clear Isolation. Complex Depedencies -&amp;gt; Hard to understand and modify. Communication using syncronous calls. Hmmm, I disagree and I think that it depends.. E.g., Spring allows services call another with asyncronous methods within the same monolith.</description></item><item><title>Random Memories</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</guid><description>Curious ideas/sentences and what not from now and then. Some things are pretty obvious but worthwhile remembering (:
Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user. User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.</description></item><item><title>readme</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</guid><description>Several examples https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

Monolith Microservices As opposed to Monolith, services do not share a database and all access must be done through a API exposed by the service. They may be in the same process (monolith) or may be separated (microservices). This reduces coupling.

Can be copied to disk to speed up recovery if a replica fails.
Best used for small data sets with infrequent updates that require high availability.
Limitations CRDT: Do not work with every data type that require a merge function. Some data types are too complex to merge and require the use of tombstone:
A marker that shows something was deleted.</description></item><item><title>Lightbend Academy</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</guid><description>Referred in
