States of data:
- *At Rest*: Data that is not consumed at the time is injested. It is stored and then consumed later in a batch process.
- *In Transit*: Data that is travelling between point A and point B.
- *In Use*: Data that is opened for treatment

Encountered several concerns regarding how such data must be handled. Follows a link to be reviewed later:[[https://www.sealpath.com/protecting-the-three-states-of-data/][ three-states-of-data]]
