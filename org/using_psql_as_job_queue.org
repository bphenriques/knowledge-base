#+TITLE: Using PSQL as job queue
#+HUGO_SECTION: posts
#+HUGO_TAGS: psql queue

Use-case: Fault Tolerant event queue in Postgres.

Consider the following table:
#+BEGIN_SRC SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "queue";
CREATE TABLE "queue" (
  "id" SERIAL,
  "dequeued_at" TIMESTAMP NULL,

  -- remaining fields relevant for the use-case. For the outbox pattern, one would be storing the event in JSON format, the event id and the event's timestamp.
);
#+END_SRC

This table represent a queue in the database. In order to fetch ~size~ elements from the queue:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
UPDATE event_queue SET dequeued_at = current_timestamp
WHERE id IN (
      SELECT id FROM queue
      WHERE dequeued_at IS NULL OR current_timestamp >= (dequeued_at + interval '1 second' second * :seconds)
      ORDER BY event_timestamp ASC
      LIMIT :size
      FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
)
RETURNING *
#+END_SRC

Breaking down:
- ~UPDATE event_queue SET dequeued_at = current_timestamp + ~FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED~ - Guarantees that multiple nodes reading N elements from the queue will have disjoint sets.
- ~WHERE dequeued_at IS NULL~ - Check if the item was already or not dequeued.
- ~current_timestamp >= (dequeued_at + interval '1 second' second * :seconds)~ - Guarantees that multiple nodes will not process the same elements. Does ~SKIP LOCKED~ already safe-guards this?
