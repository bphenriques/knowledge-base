Each actor has an address. Actors may create new actors, send messages to them and changing their own behavior to handle new messages (e.g., change the state).  An actor does not exist isolated, it works in tandem with others and are arranged in hierarquy:\n Actors can split up and delegate tasks to child actors. Child actors are supervised and delegate their failures back to their parent.  Anatomy #  Each actor has:\n An address. An mailbox. An dispatcher.  Messages are sent to an Actor Address which are enqued in the mailbox and only then are dispatched for processing. Note that, only one message is dispatched at a time leading to the ilusion of single thread (there may be multiple actor within the same system, each one handling messages in different threads).\nIt is important that that actors communicate exclusively through messages and do not shared state to ensure Strong Consistency! Moreover messages must be immutable.\n Reactive Systems #  In the context of Reactive Systems, Actor model is a reactive tool, a paradigm that:\n Actors only communicate through asyncronous messages. Message driven - All communication between actors is done with async non-blocking messages. Abstractions provide elasticity and resiliency.  Akka uses the actor model - https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/actors-intro.html?language=scala The message driven system provides location transparency, i.e., the technique remainins the same regardless of where the actors are. This allows better resiliency and elastic (hmm.. questions on this bit). This is different from \u0026ldquo;Transparent remoting\u0026rdquo; as this hides potential networking issues while making it seem like local calls. Location transparency makes the opposite which is makes local calls seem like remote calls, therefore whoever uses is aware that there are potential failures.\nAkka Actors is an implementation of the Actor Model.\n","preview":"Concept from 1973 by Carl Hewitt:\n Actor is the fundamental unit of computation embodying …"},{"id":1,"href":"/knowledge-base/notes/akka/","title":"Akka","tags":["akka"],"content":"Akka #  Toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and fault tolerant message-driven application in the JVM.

For example, using interfaces such as Future[T]. However this may lead to concurrency within the actor itself removing the ilusion of a single thread. This means that messages must be stash until other operations complete.\nIn essence the actor has 3 states:\n Loading - Load the state from the DB. Running - Regular behavior. Waiting.  Question: If DB fails, then it is recommended to throw the exception leading to a restart of the Actor that in turn will re-read the state from the DB. So:\n It is explained that the stash is not lost, how? What happens if there is a persistent issue in the DB? Will there be a loop?  Akka Actor Lifecycle #  Can be stopped by himself or by others.\nLifecycle (without faults):\nhook:preStart() -\u0026gt; started -[stop]-\u0026gt; stopped -\u0026gt; hook:postStop() -\u0026gt; terminated The actor is created assyncronously and available right away through the ActorRef.\nStopping an actor will:\n Finishes the processing the current message. Suspends message processing. Stop its children - See Actor Model . Waits for their termination confirmations and then stops himself.  How to stop: PoisonPill (context.stop(self())) and actorRef ! Kill messages (throw ActorKilledException). They are not appropriate to perform a cleanup before shutting down as the Actor does not \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; those messages (it is handled internally). It is best to use a dedicated message such as StopMeGraciouslyMessage.\nMonitor #  Dead Watch allows monitoring another actor\u0026rsquo;s termination (regular Terminated message in the receive block).\nFailure Handling #  Akka deals with failures at the level of the individual actor (bulkheading has it only affects that actor).\nDoes not throw the message back to the sender (b/c the sender does not know how to handle it). Instead the error is sent to a responsibile entity (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Manager\u0026rdquo;) that determines the required steps to recover.\nWhen an actor fails, Akka provides two configurable strategies:\n OneForOneStrategy: Only the faulty child is affected. AllForOneStrategy: All children are affected by one faulty child.  Both are configured with a type Decider = PartialFunction[Throwable, Directive]. If not defined a directive, then the parent is consired faulty. Where Directive:\n Resume: Resume message processing. Use if the state remains valid. Restart: Start a new actor in its place and resume, however all childs are stopped (by default unless preRestart hook is changed). It supports max number of retries and within a time limit. Stop. Escalate: Delegate the decision to the supervisor\u0026rsquo;s parent.  By default it is OneForOneStrategy with some directives that are too specific to group here and we can check the documentation. In short, by default, the actor will be restarted. In any case, message processing is suspended.\n All descendants of the actor are suspended. The actor\u0026rsquo;s parent handles the failure.  Proper tuning leads to a self-healing system. Some exceptions are worth stopping the actor while others are worth recovering.\nFull Lifecycle #   Ask vs Tell #  Ask: actorRef ? Message Tell: actorRef ! Message\nUse Ask when:\n Bridging non-actor code to actor-code (e.g., bridging with HTTP controllers ?). We are expecting a response within a timeout. In this case we use actorRef ? Message pipeTo self which in turn will will handle the response, e.g., val receive: Receive = { case MessageResponse =\u0026gt; stuff }.

Introducing Akka Cluster Aware Routers, that allows scalling the system horizontally. I.e., large tasks are broken on smaller tasks that are routed to an especific node of our cluster.\nAkka Cluster Sharding #  Scenario: Database becomes the bottleneck.\nMany applications leverage the database for strong-consistency. However it may become the source of contention (see Amdah\u0026rsquo;s Law ) as the load increases. We may migrate to a cache service (e.g., Memcached or Redis) but it will eventually become the bottleneck.\nIn order to solve this, Akka Cluster Sharding allows distributing Actors across the cluster responsible for managing the state of a especific database entitiy (given a hashing function). With the aid of a single-thread illusion, we can cache the entities in-memory without the risk of desyncronizing with the database, leading to strong consistency. This is great as most applications are read-heavy as opposed to write-heavy.\nAkka Distributed Data #  Scenario: Critical information that is required continously and we need maintain it.

The data is asyncronously replicated to other nodes. The consistency model varies and is configurable . Through this, we can perform updates from any node without coordination and any concurrent updates will be automatically resolved by a monotic merge function explicitly provided.\nFor this end we use a especific data-structure called Conflict Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).\nFor more, please check here .\nConflict Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) #  CRDTs are stored in-memory and can be copied to disk to speed up recovery if a replica fails.\n A marker that shows something was deleted.

Shard Region: Holds Shards. Shard Coordinator: Manages shards.  Entity #  The main unit is: Entity identified by the EntityId which in essence represents the aggregate root\u0026rsquo;s identifier of a concept of our domain (e.g., UserId) and is unique within the cluster. This leads to Strong Consistency given that Akka provides the single thread illusion.\nThe EntityId is extracted through the ExtractEntityId partial function. This is often modeled using a Envelope (which is not mandatory when the message contains the identifier):\ncase class Envelope(entityId: String, message: Any) val idExtractor: ExtractEntityId = { case Envelope(id, msg) =\u0026gt; (id, msg) } The name of the actor essentially becomes the EntityId.\nShards #  In turn, these entities are grouped into shards. The distribution depends on the its identifiers (ShardId) are generated which is usually based on EntityId. An improper distribution leads to a unbalanced cluster, which leads to hotspots (e.g., names, dates, auto-incrementing ids). As rule of thumb, use ~10 shards per node as too many may be costly to find them and too short reduces the capability to distribute them.\nIn general, the identifier shard identifier is modelled as follows:\nval shardIdExtractor: ExtractShardId = { case Envelope(id, _) =\u0026gt; (Math.abs(id.hashCode % totalShards)).toString } Shard Region #  For a type of entity, there is usually one Shard Region per JVM, in other words, we instantiate a shard region (for a given actor type) on every node that we want to host shards. Alternatively, we may merely create a proxy to a shard region. Last but not the least, a shard region is a ActorRef that we can send messages as usual.\nShard Coordinator #  Manages shards. It is responsible to route the messages addressed to a specific entity. It provides the location of the shard which can then be used to acccess the entity.\nRuns as an Akka Cluster singleton and it does not do much of work therefore rarely becomes a bottleneck.\nFrom Stateless systems to Stateful systems #  Strong consistency in a stateless system is done by leveraging a DB as the source of truth, to maintain Strong Consistency. However, as the system grows the DB may become a bottleneck. We can leverage Sharding:\n Load is distributed across multiple machines in the cluster. State can be cached for fast access with no need to read from DB. Strong Consistency is guaranteed by sharded actors backed by the single thread illusion.  The actors may now become a source of contention, however it is distributed across multiple machines. This means that the system is Elastic and we can scale as needed.\nWhen there is a failure, it is located in a single actor - Bulkheading.\nStateful Actors #  Read may be done directly from the state. But writes may have to go through the DB followed by a update of our internal state. This is important as when the Actor fails, we need to rebuild our internal state from DB.\nIn order to avoid blocking the system while reading from the DB we can use the Stash to store incoming messages until we rebuild the internal state. See following example:\nclass MyActor(repository: Repository) extends Actor with Stash { var state: Option[State] = None repository.read(id) // Non-blocking DB. Asyncronous read from DB.  .map(state =\u0026gt; StateLoaded(state)) // Notify so that we can change the current context  .pipeTo(self) def receive: Receive = loading def loading: Receive = { case StateLoaded(s) =\u0026gt; state = Some(s) unstashAll // read all accumulated messages as soon as we process this message \tcontext.become(running) case State.failure(ex) =\u0026gt; throw ex // Best practice: trigger the restart of the actor by default. The stashed messages are not lost.  case _ =\u0026gt; stash() } def running: Receive = { //regular handler  } } Now when we introduce operations that need to update the DB we need to fine-tune this.\ncase class UpdateState(foo: Int) case class StateUpdated(state: Option[State]) class MyActor(repository: Repository) extends Actor with Stash { var state: Option[State] = None repository.read(id) // Non-blocking DB. Asyncronous read from DB.  .map(state =\u0026gt; StateLoaded(state)) // Notify so that we can change the current context  .pipeTo(self) def receive: Receive = loading def loading: Receive = { case StateLoaded(s) =\u0026gt; state = Some(s) unstashAll // read all accumulated messages as soon as we process this message \tcontext.become(running) case State.failure(ex) =\u0026gt; throw ex // Best practice: trigger the restart of the actor by default. The stashed messages are not lost.  case _ =\u0026gt; stash() } def running: Receive = { case UpdateState(foo) =\u0026gt; context.become(waiting) repository.update(state.copy(foo = foo)) .map(StateUpdate.apply) .pipeTo(self)(sender()) // send message to self as soon as the operation is done with the original sender() to reply back to  } def waiting: Receive = { case evt @ StateUpdate(state) =\u0026gt; unstashAll() // enqueue messages not processed while the DB was being written. \tcontext.become(running) // can process messages as usual \tsender() ! evt // reply back to the original sender  case failure @ Status.Failure(ex) =\u0026gt; log.error(s\u0026#34;[orderId] FAILURE: ${ex.getMessage}\u0026#34;) sender() ! failure // make sure we reply back \tthrow ex // trigger actor restart  case _ =\u0026gt; stash() } Passivation #  This fenomenon can be observer through small dips in the throughput. This happens as the Actors attempts to manage the number of actors in-memory as keep all of them is unreasonable. E.g., idle actors.\nEach actor tracks the time it processed a message. If it hadn\u0026rsquo;t processed a message within a configured time period, it will Passivate, leading to the removal of the actor in-memory.\nThe period must be tune-up, too long may lead to OOM and too short may lead to constant reads from the DB. Best practise is to determine and then tune up by watching the memory usage.\nIt can also be done manually by sending a Passivate message to the parent.\nRebalancing #  Occurs whenever the size of the cluster changes. The Shard coordinator will initiate the rebalancing process by distributing the shards across the all available nodes in order to keep an even distribution of entities.\nThis can only occur in a healthy cluster. Therefore any unreachable nodes must be removed (and terminated before) either manually through Akka Management or using the Lightbend Split Brain Resolver.\nSteps:\n Coordinator informs Regions that a rebalance has started. Messages to an entity on a moving shard are buffered. Oce shared was rebalanced, the queued messages are sent  During rebalancing, the messages delivered follow the at-most-once semantics.\nThere are several Shard Allocation Strategies, the default one is LeastShardAllocationStrategy.\nHowever, the shards are not automatically restarted. In order for it to happen one needs to use \u0026ldquo;Remember Entities\u0026rdquo; with some costs.\nRemember Entities #  By enabling remember-entities, when a node restarts/rebalances, it will restore entities. This works by informing every member every time each entity starts or stops (using Akka distributed data) and stored in a durable storage in the disk (it can be recovered even after full cluster restart). However, this be disabled on environments without persistent storage (e.g., Kubernetes), in those cases use eventsourced data mode (see documentation ).\nWarning!\n Enabling this disables automatic passivation. It is not cheap as every node will have to be informed of all running entities, which leads to an overhead starting/stopping them.  Best practice is to limit when we have a limited number of active entities. Most of times is not really needed as entities will be removed automatically through Passivation brought back when needed. However some use-cases:\n When the entity has a scheduled process that may not have completed. When the time to restart an entity on demand could cause the system to backup (long startup times). When the resource savings of passivating the Entities are insignificant.  With this feature, the node\u0026rsquo;s ExtractShardId function must handle ShardRegion.StartEntity(entityId).\nNote: During startup, some nodes may become overwhelmed. In order to avoid concentrating the shards on a single member of the cluster we set the minimum number of members under cluster settings. This allows unnecessary rebalances during the startup. While the cluster has not enough members, existing members will remain in the Join state.\n","preview":"Akka Cluster Sharding #  Distribute actors across a cluster:\n Entities: The main unit …"},{"id":7,"href":"/knowledge-base/notes/akka_streams/","title":"Akka Streams","tags":["akka","stream"],"content":"Actor Streams leverage the actor system to consume streams of data.

The opposite means that it is a partial graph. }).run() It is also possible to build partial graphs, or Shapes. There are already some built-in:\n Linear Shapes (\u0026lt;Source|Flow|Sink\u0026gt;Shape) Junction Shapes with the same input/output types (UniformFan\u0026lt;In|Out\u0026gt;Shape). Junction Shapes with different inputs/outputs types (Fan\u0026lt;In|Out\u0026gt;Shape\u0026lt;arity\u0026gt;).  Simpler graphs can be done using, for example, the simpler Sink.combine API.\nFusion #  By default, Akka \u0026ldquo;fuses\u0026rdquo; all stages onto a single syncronous one to run on a single actor (auto-fusing can be disabled) but this limits the benefits we are looking for.\n In order to add a asyncronous boundary, we just need to add async which disables fusing for that stage, which means that we are adding an additional overhead (Actors, mailboxes and buffers). Its benefits largely depends on the use-case. A good principle is\n  Insert an async boundary to bisect the stream into two subsections of roughly equal processing time. We insert an async boundary to bisect the stream into two subsections of roughly equal processing time.   In other words, check at the current pipeline where the stages can be split so that they can be performed in paralell and joined almost at the same time. This implies looking at Telemetry and verify which stages can be processed in paralell given the graph we have.\n","preview":"Actor Streams leverage the actor system to consume streams of data.

Some use cases:\n Auditing (e.g., banking, accounting) High Scalability High Resiliency  This separation allows both concerns to evolve separately depending on the requirements. For example, some Aggregate Roots are a better fit for write models but do not fit other read models.\nThis pattern is often combined with Event Sourcing (ES) .\nEventually consistent by design which always present but now is explicit about it.\nHow: #  Application is split between two models:\n Command Model: Handles requests to change the state of the application and decide its side-effects, e.g., events or new commands. Query Model (or View Model or Projection): Focus on data and not on behavior and are modelled to satisfy a very specific need, therefore it is usual having multiple of them.

New Projections are easy in CQRD/ES. New projections are retroactive because we have the fully history.  Models as Microservices #   Write Model can become a microservice Read Model can become a microservice  This assumes that it uses different databases (as expected from proper microservices). Otherwise the database may become the bottleneck.\nBetter yet: Each projection in its own Microservice. \\[\\]\\[\\]\\[\\] and maintentance.\nConsistency #  Simple (without ES) has the same consistency as non-CQRS systems. CQRD/ES can have different consistency models for the read or the write models.\nWrite Model #  Strong is often important here because we want that those write be based on the current state. This consistency is usually implemented through locks or sharding in a more reactive way.\nRead Model #  Pure reads are never consistent as they are often working with stale data.

Performance optimizes response time (latency) while scalability optimizes ability to handle load. Requests per second actually measures both but we do not know which aspect was improved.\nNote Scalability is not the number of requests qwe can handle a in a given period of time (req/sec) but he number of requests itself (load).\nIf x axis is number of requests (Load) and y axis is response time. Improving performance leads to decrease in the y axis. Improving scalability means a shift on the x axis meaning that we can handle more requests with the same response time.\nStill confused as if I improve performance I should free up resources to handle more requests..\nReactive Microservices focus on improving scalability.\nConsistency: #  All members of the system have the same view or state. This does not factors time.\nEventual Consistency #  Guarantees that, in the absence of new updates, all accesses to a specific piece of data will eventually return the most recent data.\nDifferent forms:\n Eventual Consistency Causal Consistency Sequential Conssitency others  E.g., Source control are eventually consistent. All the code reading is potentially out-of-date and a merge operations is relied upon to bring the local state back to speed.\nTODO: Check each one #  Strong Consistency #  An update to a piece of data needs agreement from all nodes before it becomes visible.\nPhysically it is impossible therefore we simulate: Locks that introduce overhead in the form of contention. Now it becomes a single resource which eliminates the distributed nature. Tying the distributed problem to a non-distributed resource.\nTraditionally, monoliths are based around strong consistency.\nEffects of contention #  Definition: Any two things that contend for a single limited resource and only one will win and the other will be forced to wait.\nAs the number of resources disputing for the resource, more time time it will take to finally free up the resources.\nSee: -Amdah\u0026rsquo;s Law  Gunther\u0026rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law      Coherence Delay\nDefinition: Time it takes for synchronization to complete on a distributed systems - My definition following below notes:\nSyncronization is done using crosstalk or gossip - Each system sends messages to each other node informing of any state changes. The time it takes for the cynscronization to complete is called Coeherency Delay.\nIncreasing the number of nodes increases the delay.\n     Laws of scalability\nBoth these laws demonstrate that linear scalability is almost always unachivable. Such is only possible if the system lieve in total isolation.\n     Reactive Systems\nReduce contention by:\n Isolating locks Eliminating transactions Avoiding blocking operations  Mitigate coherency delays by:\n Embracing Eventual Consistency Building in Autonmy  This allows for higher scalability as we reduce or eliminate these factors.\n  CAP Theorem #  States that a distributed system cannnot provide more than than two of the following:\n Consistency Availability Partition Tolerance  One has to pick one of the following combinations:\n (CP) Consistent and Partition Tolerance (AP) Available and Partition Tolerance.  In practice, they may claim CP/AP except for some edge-cases. It is a balance.\nPartition Tolerance #  The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network.\nThey can occur due to:\n Problems in the network. When a node goes down.  May be short or long lived.\nTwo options:\n (AP) Sacrifice Consistency: Allow writes to both sides of the partition. This require merging the data in order to restore consistency. (CP) Sacrifice Availability: Disabling or terminating on side of the partitions. During this, some or all of your system will be unavailable.  Sharding as a way to have strong consistency #  Limit the scope of the contention and reduce crosstalk. Is applied within the application. It is not the same type of sharding used in some databases, the technique is similar though.\nAllows strong consistency.\nPartitions entities (or Actors) in the domain according to their id.\nGroups of entities are called a shard and each entity only exists in one shard.\nEach shard exists in only one location. This fact eliminates the distributed systems problem.\nThe entity acts as a consistency boundary.\nIn order for this to work, we need to have a coordinator that ensures that traffic for a particular entity is routed to the correct location. The coordinator uses the ID to calculate the appropriate shard.\nAggregate Roots are good candidate for sharding.\nIt is important to have a balanced shards and that requires a good sharding key - UUIDs or hashcodes. Poor key selections will result in hotspots.\nRule of thumb: 10x as many shards as nodes.\nAkka provides this as a means to distribute actors across a cCLuster in a shared setup. Lagom persistent entities levarage akka cluster sharding to distribute the entities across the cluster.\nWhat about resharding? when a system goes down\u0026hellip;\nSharding allows a great caching solution as:\n We can store the cache results after writing to the database Databases is effectively write-only which can speed up things We only consult the cache during reads. Begs the question: How many items and what is the TTL? Well.. it for certain reduces the read on the DB but that is not forever unless we have infinite memory.  Effects #   Does not eliminate contention. It solely isolates to a single entity. The router/coordinator represents a source of contention as well. A shareded system minimizes contention by:  Limiting the amounf of work the router/coordinator performs - By storing where the shard is after asking the coordinator - How to invalidate that cache due to failures? Isolates contention to individual entities    Scalability is doen by distributing the shards over mode machines. Strong consistency is achiaved by isolating operations to a specific entity. Careful choice of shard keys is important to maintain a good scalability.\nFailure #  Sharding sacrifices availability. Once a shard goes down, there will be a period of time where it is unavailable and wil migrate to another node eventually.\nCRDTs provide a availability solution based on async replication #  Conflict-free Replicated Data\nOn the application level.\nHighly available and eventually consistent.\nSpecially designed data type.\nUpdates are applied on one replica and then copied async.\nUdpdates are merged to determine the final state.\nTwo types:\n CvRDT - Convergent Replicated Data Type copy state between replicas. Requires a merge operation that understands how to combine two states. These operations must be: commutative, associative and idempotent. CmRDT - Commutative Replicated Data Types. These copy operations isntead of state.

Look for variations of the ubiquitous language as they may suggest a new context. Look for variations where informations starts to become or relevant or irrelevant.

Provides a higher level of reliability.  Disavantages:\n Make transactions more difficult. How to manage long running transactions that span multiple microservices. Holding transactions open for long periods result in slow, brittle systems.  The role of syncronous messags:\n Can you acknowledge the message but process it asyncronously? The need for syncronous messages should be driven by domain requirements rather than technical convenience.  Sagas #  Represent long running transaction. Multiple requests are managed by a Saga.\nIndividual requests are run in sequence or in paralel.\nHow:\n Each request is paired with a compensating action. If any requests fails, compnesation actions are executed for all completed steps. Then the saga is completed with a failure. If compensation actions fails, then it is retried. This requires idempotency.  Timeouts in distributed systems:\n  Eitehr the request failed.\n  Either it was successful but the reply failed.\n  The request is still queued and may success or fail eventually.\nCompensating actions != Rollbacks.\nRollback: implies the transaction has not completed which removes the evidence of the transaction. Compensation: Applied on top of a previously completed action. Evidence of the orignal action remains.\n  Disavantages:\n Coupled to the failures unless we can move regardless of that. Saga are often implemented using ackka actors and represented via Finite State Machine.  Two General Problem #  Illustrate the impossibility of reaching a concensus over an unreliable communication channel.\nDelivery Guarantees #   Exactly Once: Is not possible in the event of a network partition, or lost message. We never guarantee that the message was in-fact sent. Failure requires resending the message which creates potential duplicates. Reuqires storage on both ends: unreliable network (as always); timeouts. At most once - If a failure occur, no retries are done which means no duplications but there may be losses. Requires no storage of messages. At least once - Require a acknoledge and teh sender needs to store state to track whether the messsage was acknowledge. It ahs to be stored in a durable data store.  Exactly once can be simulated using at least once and idempotency.\nAkka: at most once by default. Akka persistence has option to have at least once.\nMessaging Patterns #  Publish Subscribe #  Decoupled. The only coupling is on the message format and possibily the location (e.g., url, exchange on the message broker). Complexity is hard to see as we do not know where the message comes from.\nPoint to point #  Dependencies more clear but coupling is higher. COmplexity is directly observable.\nExamples #  Kafaka, RabbitMQ.

Each have its own data store. Independent and self governing. Communication is syncronous or asyncronous (e.g., through messaging systems). Loose coupling between components (more or less by experience but that is design flaw likely :thinking:). Shorter development and release cycles. Each scale independently (either through physical or virtual machines).  Advantages #   Deployed/Scaled as needed. Increase availability due to reduced single point of failures. Better isolation leading to less couling giving flexibility. Supports multiple platforms and languages. More indepentent Shorter cycles  Mention that cross team coordination become less necessary. That is true but often it still is and requires coordination.\nDisavantages #   Require multiple complex deployment nad monitoring approaches. Cross service refactors are more challenging. Require supporting old versions. Organization Change  Designing one #  Business domains are typically large and complicated. Several ideas, actions and rules interact with one another in complex ways. A good approach on understanding such complex systems and how to model them is through a process named Domain Driven Design .\nA correct separation of concerns (i.e., clear and single responsibilities) leads to smoother workflows. Awkarwdness when modelling may indicate lack of understanding of the domain.\nPrinciples of Isolation #  State #  All access must go thorugh the API and there is no backdoors. Allows internal changes without affecting others.\nSpace #  Should not care where the other services are deployed. Allows microservices to be scaled up or down to meet demands. However, if latency is an issue, they should be in the same region.\nTime #  Should not wait for each other which allows more efficient use of resources. Resources can be freed immediatly, rather than waiting for a request to finish.\nBetween microservices we expect eventual consistency. It improves scalability as total consitency requires central coordination which hindes scalability.\nNOTE: This is discussible. However it may be a implementation details.\nFailure #  Isolate failures and should not cause failure on other systems. I.e., it still is responsive to attend other use-cases.\nIsolation Techniques #  Bulkheading #  Failures are isolated to failure zones. Failures in one service will not propagate to other services. Overall the system remains operation but possibly in a degraded state.\nIn practice it means that that systems that depend on the service that is considered a failure zone, will mark that information or service as unavailable. IMO this is tolerable if the service is non-critical.\nCircuit Breaker #  When a service is under stress we do not want to keep on retrying as it may make things worse.\nWay to avoid overloading a service. They qaurantine a failing service so it can fail fast. Allows the failing service to recover in its time before they fail.\nTypes:\n Closed - Normal Operation Open - Fail fast Half Open - Internally after a timeout will let one request to go through and if it fails, it goes back to Open.  Transitions:\n Closed (normal) -\u0026gt; Trip: Open (Fail Fast) Open (Fail fast) -\u0026gt; Attempt Reset: Half Open Half Open -\u0026gt; Trip: Open (fail Fast) Half Open -\u0026gt; Reset: Closed (Normal)  Message Driven Architecture #   Async and non blocking messages allows decoupling both time and failure. System do not depend on the response from on another. If a request to a service fails, the failure will not propagated. The client service isn\u0026rsquo;t waiting for response. It can continue to operate normally.  Autonomy #  Services can operate independently from each other.\nAutonomous services have enough information to resolve conflicts and repair failures. This means that they do not require other services to be operational all the time. Ideally all the time but in reality for a short time it guarantees some level of autonomy.\nBenefits:\n Stronger scalability and availability. Can be scaled indefinetly. Operate independently.  How:\n Async messages. Maintain enough internal state ofr the microservices to function in isolation. Use eventual consistency. Avoid direct, syncronous dependencies on external services.  API Gateway Services #  Microservices can lead to complexity in the API. How can we manage complex APIs that access many microservices?\nA new microservice that is put between the client and the N-services that are required to fulfill that request. This new microservice is responsible for aggregating the responses moving the responsbility from the client itself. This way, the client only needs to manage failures from the gateway.\nThis effectively creates an additional layer of isolation.\n!! This is specially useful for mobile applicatios where we cannot guarantee that the clients will update their app.\n","preview":"Subset of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) where each service is deployed separately: …"},{"id":32,"href":"/knowledge-base/notes/monolith/","title":"Monolith","tags":["system-design"],"content":"Characteristics #   Deployed as a single unit.
