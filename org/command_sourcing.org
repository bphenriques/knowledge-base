* Command Sourcing

Similar to [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578c7][Event Sourcing (ES)]] but persists commands as opposed to events so:
1. Issue command
2. Persist command
3. Run asyncronous the command

- They should be idempotent as they run multiple times (e.g., failures).
- Must be validated so that they do not become stuck in the queue forever.
- Bad: The sender might not be notified if the command fails due to the decouple nature.
