* Hi! ðŸŒ±

Welcome to my [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578c4][Digital Garden]]! A frictionless writing space where I collect, arrange, and connect my thoughts as I explore
new or existing topics.

Learning can be hard. Having incremental notes and linking them is a great way to turn insights into knowledge, and with
experience, make good use of it!

You can explore all the notes in this digital garden using the following graph:

It is an extension of my thinking process, therefore, some of these notes may be raw or incomplete as I explore them. Let me know if you find mistakes or just want to say hi!
