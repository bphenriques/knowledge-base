#+ROAM_ALIAS:

The engine of Akka as it decides when a actor should process messsages and when it must yield the thread for others. It means that dispatchers are in control of the thread time and of the threads themselves.

- ~Dispatcher~ (default): Event-driven dispatcher, sharing threads from thread pool.
- ~PinnedDispatcher~: Dedicated thread per actor.
- ~CallingThreadDispatcher~: Just for testing.

The best tips are:
- Adjust ~throughput~ to deliver more messages to the actors before yielding.
- Adjust dispatcher settings according to the use-case.
