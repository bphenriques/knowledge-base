* Akka

Toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and fault tolerant message-driven application in the JVM. It can be used to build [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578e1][Reactive Systems]].

Proposes unified programming model for:
- Simpler concurrency: single threaded illusion as each actor processes a message at a time (no need to locks or synchronization strategies).
- Simpler distribution: is distributed by default (see more on [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578b3][Akka Cluster]]).
- Simpler fault tolerance: Decouples communication from failure handling.
