Some personal notes on simplifying the process so that one can focus on getting back to the other tasks at hand.

* On Reporting Bugs

- Focus on the impact for the client.
- You do not need to debug right away.
- You do not need to establish the timeline - The report can solely include the context.
- The person assigned to the issue will pick on the context provided in the ticket and explore.
