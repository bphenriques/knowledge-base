- *Service Level Indicator (SLI)*: Performance indicator measured as a ratio of two numbers.
- *Service Level Objective (SLO)*: Defines a target SLI as measurment of the systems's reliability.
- *Service Level Agreement (SLA)*: Business contract regarding the expected SLO.

It is far productive measuring them as use-histories as it defines the critical paths.
