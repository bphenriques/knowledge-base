* Akka

Toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and fault tolerant message-driven application in the JVM. It can be used to build [[file:../system-design/reactive_systems.org][Reactive Systems.]]

Proposes unified programming model for:
- Simpler concurrency: single threaded ilusion as each actor processes a messsage at a time (no need to locks or syncronization strategues).
- Simpler distribution: is distributed by default (see more on [[file:../akka/akka_cluster.org][Akka Cluster]]).
- Simpler fault tolerancy: Decouples communication from failure handling.
