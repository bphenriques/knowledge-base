* Command Sourcing

Similar to [[file:event_sourcing.org][Event Sourcing]] but persists commands as opposed to events so:
1. Issue command
2. Persist command
3. Run asyncronous the command

- They should be idempotent as they run multiple times (e.g., failures).
- Must be validated so that they do not become stuck in the queue forever.
- Bad: The sender might not be notified if the command fails due to the decouple nature.
