Lightbend Academy In the context of Reactive Systems, Actor model is a reactive tool, a paradigm that:
Message driven - All communication between actors is done with async non-blocking messages. Abstractions provide elasticity and resiliency. Akka uses the actor model - https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/actors-intro.html?language=scala
Fundamental All computation occurs inside of the actor. Each actor has an address. Actors only communicate through asyncronous messages. The message driven system provides location transparency, i.</description></item><item><title>Apache Spark</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</guid><description>#ROAM_TAGS: data

On Reporting Bugs Focus on the impact for the client. You do not need to debug right away. You do not need to establish the timeline - The report can solely include the context. The person assigned to the issue will pick on the context provided in the ticket and explore.</description></item><item><title>Domain Driven Design</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/domain_driven_design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/domain_driven_design/</guid><description>See raw in Lightbend Academy
Useful for modelling use-cases before attempting to implement it whether in Software or mere Diagrams.
Subject-Verb-Object notation Allows having a consistent way to phrase activies our events in the domain.
Example: Host checks current reservation.
Subject: Host Verb: Checks Object: Reservation Note that &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; can be seen as a modifier.
Sometimes there may be multiple objects. E.g., &amp;ldquo;Bartender collects Payment for a Drink Order&amp;rdquo;:</description></item><item><title>Jackson</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/jvm/jackson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/jvm/jackson/</guid><description>Sane Settings After working a while with this I want to register these sane defaults:
configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES, true) configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false) FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES Setting FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES forces clients to explicitely provide all values including primitives. Consider the following POJO:
data class Foo(bar: Boolean) Without the setting, a payload such as { } would render ~Foo(bar=false)~ despite the lack of default value. Given this, to guarantee consistency between the source-code and the external contract, I advise enabling this.</description></item><item><title>JWT</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/security/jwt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/security/jwt/</guid><description>What it is JSON Web Tokens

Some things are pretty obvious but worthwhile remembering (:
Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user. User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.</description></item><item><title>readme</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</guid><description>Several examples https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

Corollary 3: if you&amp;rsquo;re right, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, then you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn&amp;rsquo;t, then they&amp;rsquo;re right and you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. Corollary 5: if you prove someone&amp;rsquo;s solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better.</description></item><item><title>Lightbend Academy</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</guid><description>Referred in
Domain Driven Design Some notes regarding Lighbend academy at https://academy.lightbend.com/. Taking this opportunity as it is free during this summer.
Hope to learn more about Reactive + Akka + Actors + Streams.
Hmmm&amp;hellip; is Data Engineering something I would like to work with? :thinking:
