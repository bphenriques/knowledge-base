* TODO REVIEW THESE NOTES - Architectural Patterns

As opposed to [[file:monolith.org][Monolith]], services do not share a database and all access must be done through a API exposed by the service. They may be in the same process ([[file:monolith.org][Monolith]]) or may be separated ([[file:microservices.org][Microservices]]). This reduces coupling.
