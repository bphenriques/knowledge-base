Increasing concurrency can cause negative resutrns due to contention and coherency delay.

Picks from [[id:2fa03d4f-948e-4a6e-a38b-178456b578b9][Amdah's Law]]. In addition to contention, it accounts for coeherency delay.

As the system scales up, the cost to coordinate between nodes exceeds any benefits.
