Context: TODO
At a regular interval, each member sends their view of the cluster state to a random node, including:
The status of each member If each member has seen this version of the cluster state. Eventually consistent as after some time (aka convergence), all nodes will share the same state. Each node decides if it has reached convergence.</description></item><item><title>Heartbeat</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/heartbeat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/heartbeat/</guid><description>In order to detect failures, systems communicate with one another to verify communication. If the communication is deemed broken, then the system may be considered as Unreachable depending on he heartbeat history and how the Failure Detection is configured. I.e., a single heartbeat does not mean that the member is Unreachable.</description></item></channel></rss>
