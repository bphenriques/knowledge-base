Technique used by some data stores to reduce contention without sacrificing consistency.

Records are distributed across nodes using a /Shard Key/ or a /Partition Key/ that will be used by the /Database Router/ that redirects requests to the correct shard/partition.

Benefits:
- Contention is isolated to a shard/partition.
- Given that each shard stores a part of the dataset, it is only handling a small part of the overall load.
- Improves elasticity.

However, with time the database will still be a bottleneck because there may be too many users acesssing the shards/partitions (sometimes it may be a bad choice of partition key).
