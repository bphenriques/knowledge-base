Actor is the fundamental unit of computation embodying processing, storage, and communication.
Fundamentals # All computation occurs inside of the actor. Each actor has an address. Actors may create new actors, send messages to them and changing their own behavior to handle new messages (e.g., change the state). An actor does not exist isolated, it works in tandem with others and are arranged in hierarquy:</description></item><item><title>Amdah's Law</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/amdah_s_law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/amdah_s_law/</guid><description>In short, contention limits paralelization.
Defines the maximum improvement gaines by parallel procesing. Improvements from paralelization are limited to the code that can be paralelized. Contention limits such paralism reducing the advantages of the improvements. Does not matter as long as the contention exist.</description></item><item><title>Gunther's Universal Scalability Law</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/gunther_s_universal_scalability_law/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/notes/gunther_s_universal_scalability_law/</guid><description>Increasing concurrency can cause negative resutrns due to contention and coherency delay.
Picks from Amdah&amp;rsquo;s Law . In addition to contention, it accounts for coeherency delay.
As the system scales up, the cost to coordinate between nodes exceeds any benefits.</description></item></channel></rss>
