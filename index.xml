Event Sourcing Eventually consistent by design which always present but now is explicit about it.
Some Aggregate Roots are a better fit for write models but do not fit other read models. Requirements for both models are different.
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) aims to separate read models from write models. This is specially problematic when using Event Sourcing. Note that Event Sourcing is not a requirement for CQRS but are often combined.</description></item><item><title>Command Sourcing</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/command_sourcing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/command_sourcing/</guid><description>Command Sourcing # Similar to Event Sourcing but persists commands as opposed to events so:
Issue command
Persist command
Run asyncronous the command
They should be idempotent as they run multiple times (e.g., failures).
Must be validated so that they do not become stuck in the queue forever.
Bad: The sender might not be notified if the command fails due to the decouple nature.</description></item><item><title>Consistency And Availability</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/consistency_and_availability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/consistency_and_availability/</guid><description>Scalability # It can meets increases in demand while remaining responsive.
This is different from performance. Performance optimizes response time (latency) while scalability optimizes ability to handle load. Requests per second actually measures both but we do not know which aspect was improved.
Note Scalability is not the number of requests qwe can handle a in a given period of time (req/sec) but he number of requests itself (load).</description></item><item><title>CQRS/ES</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/cqrs_es/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/cqrs_es/</guid><description>CQRS/ES stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing.
Use Cases:
Auditing (e.g., banking, accounting) High Scalability High Resiliency There are trade-offs, what are they?
CQRS # State Based Persistence. Every time an update is applied to the database it obliterates previous state.
Can&amp;rsquo;t fix bad state due to previous error. Can&amp;rsquo;t retroactively apply new domain insights (because we do not have the previous states). This solely tells where we are but not how we got there: must be allied with Event Sourcing.</description></item><item><title>Curriculum</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/curriculum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/curriculum/</guid><description>Some reference pages:

Example: Host checks current reservation.
Subject: Host Verb: Checks Object: Reservation Note that &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; can be seen as a modifier.

CQRS/ES Command Sourcing Event Sourcing (ES) # In addition to persisting state, one persists audit logs. This captures the history. It is better to have this in a database as it provides transactionality.

Service Oriented Architecture Sobre qq coisa Subset of Service Oriented Architecture where each service is deployed separately:
Microservices can be physically separated and independently deployed. Each have its own data store. Independent and self governing. Communication is syncronous or asyncronous (e.g., through message brokers). Loose coupling between components (more or less by experience but that is design flaw likely :thinking:). Shorter development and release cycles.</description></item><item><title>Monolith</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</guid><description>Referred in
Domain Driven Design Service Oriented Architecture Some notes taken during the lightbend course on Reactive Microservices. Some of these ideas are familiar as they are intuitive.
Deployed as a single unit. No Clear Isolation. Complex Depedencies -&amp;gt; Hard to understand and modify. Communication using syncronous calls. Hmmm, I disagree and I think that it depends.. E.g., Spring allows services call another with asyncronous methods within the same monolith.</description></item><item><title>Random Memories</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</guid><description>Curious ideas/sentences and what not from now and then. Some things are pretty obvious but worthwhile remembering (:
Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user. User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.</description></item><item><title>Reactive Systems</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/reactive_systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/reactive_systems/</guid><description>Goal # Provide an experience that is responsive under all conditions.
This requires:
Ability to scale from 10 users to million of users. Consume solely the resources required to support the current work-load. Reactor Principles # Responsive # Always respond in a timely manner.
Resiliency # Isolate failures on single components - Similar to how a boat is designed.
Elastic # Keep responsive specially when the system load changes which provides a more efficient usage of resources.</description></item><item><title>Readme</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</guid><description>Several examples # https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme Like minimalistic versions as they require less maintenance (hmmm :thinking-face:)</description></item><item><title>Service Oriented Architecture</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/service_oriented_architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/service_oriented_architecture/</guid><description> Referred in

Domain Driven Design Reactive Programming vs Reactive Systems # They are not the same.
Reactive systems apply the reactive principles on a architectural level.
Reactive Programming can be (and often is) used to build reactive systems but that does not mean that it is a reactive system.
In order to have a reactive architecture, it means that the reactive systems needs to be separated thorugh asyncronous boundaries.</description></item><item><title>Nix</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/nix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/nix/</guid><description> Referred in
