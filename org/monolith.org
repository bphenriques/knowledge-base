* Charateristics

- Deployed as a single unit.
- No Clear Isolation.
- Complex Depedencies which in turn makes it hard to understand and modify.
- Big Bang Style Releases
- Long Cycle Times
- Careful releases
- Scalation is done with multiple copies and uses the database as consistency between them.

* Advantages:
- Easy Cross Module Refactor
- Easier to maitain consistency
- Single Deploy Process
- Single thing to monitor
- Simple Scalability Model

* Disavantages:
- Limited by the maximum size of a single phyisical machine.
- Only scales as the database allows.
- Components are scaled as a group.
- Deep coupling.
- Long Dev Cycle.
- Lack of reliaability given that one failure may impact the whole monolith.

* Tearing it up

Introduce domain boundaries within the application itself (e.g., libraries). This falls within [[file:service_oriented_architecture_soa.org][Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)]].
