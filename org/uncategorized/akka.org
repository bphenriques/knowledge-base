* Akka Distributed Data

CRDTs in distributed data are stored in memory. Can be copied to disk to speed up recovery if a replica fails.

Best used for small data sets with infrequent updates that require high availability.

Limitations CRDT: Do not work with every data type that require a merge function. Some data types are too complex to merge and require the use of /tombstone/:
- A marker that shows something was deleted.
- Can result in data types that only get larger and never smaller.
- Aka CRDT Garbage
