Lightbend Academy In the context of Reactive Systems, Actor model is a reactive tool, a paradigm that:
Message driven - All communication between actors is done with async non-blocking messages. Abstractions provide elasticity and resiliency. Akka uses the actor model - https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/actors-intro.html?language=scala
Fundamental # All computation occurs inside of the actor. Each actor has an address. Actors only communicate through asyncronous messages.</description></item><item><title>Apache Spark</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/data-processing/apache-spark/</guid><description>#ROAM_TAGS: data

This is different from performance. Performance optimizes response time (latency) while scalability optimizes ability to handle load. Requests per second actually measures both but we do not know which aspect was improved.
Note Scalability is not the number of requests qwe can handle a in a given period of time (req/sec) but he number of requests itself (load).</description></item><item><title>Distributed Systems</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/distribute_systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/distribute_systems/</guid><description>Definition: Systems that are separated by space.

Useful for modelling use-cases before attempting to implement it whether in Software or mere Diagrams.
Subject-Verb-Object notation # Allows having a consistent way to phrase activies our events in the domain.
Example: Host checks current reservation.
Subject: Host Verb: Checks Object: Reservation Note that &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; can be seen as a modifier.
Sometimes there may be multiple objects.</description></item><item><title>Hands-on Scala Programming</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/learning/hands_on_scala_programming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/learning/hands_on_scala_programming/</guid><description>Follows my notes on the Haoyi Li.&amp;rsquo;s book: &amp;ldquo;Hands-on Scala Programming&amp;rdquo;.

Advantages:
Resources are freed immediatly. Reduced contention Messages can be queued for deleivery in case the receiver&amp;rsquo;s is offline. Provides a higher level of reliability. Disavantages:
Make transactions more difficult. How to manage long running transactions that span multiple microservices. Holding transactions open for long periods result in slow, brittle systems.

Service Oriented Architecture Subset of Service Oriented Architecture where each service is deployed separately:
Microservices can be physically separated and independently deployed. Each have its own data store. Independent and self governing. Communication is syncronous or asyncronous (e.g., through message brokers). Loose coupling between components (more or less by experience but that is design flaw likely :thinking:). Shorter development and release cycles. Each scale independently (either through physical or virtual machines).</description></item><item><title>Monolith</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/system-design/monolith/</guid><description>Referred in
Domain Driven Design Service Oriented Architecture Some notes taken during the lightbend course on Reactive Microservices. Some of these ideas are familiar as they are intuitive.
Deployed as a single unit. No Clear Isolation. Complex Depedencies -&amp;gt; Hard to understand and modify. Communication using syncronous calls. Hmmm, I disagree and I think that it depends.. E.g., Spring allows services call another with asyncronous methods within the same monolith.</description></item><item><title>Patterns</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/reactive-architecture/patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/reactive-architecture/patterns/</guid><description>CQRS/ES: Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing.
Two tools that can be combined.
Use Cases:
Auditing (e.g., banking, accounting) High Scalability High Resiliency There are trade-offs, what are they?
State Based Persistence # CQRS # State Based Persistence. Every time an update is applied to the database it obliterates previous state.
Can&amp;rsquo;t fix bad state due to previous error. Can&amp;rsquo;t retroactively apply new domain insights (because we do not have the previous states).</description></item><item><title>Random Memories</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/work/random-memories/</guid><description>Curious ideas/sentences and what not from now and then. Some things are pretty obvious but worthwhile remembering (:
Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user. User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don&amp;rsquo;t properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.</description></item><item><title>readme</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/documentation/readme/</guid><description>Several examples # https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

Monolith Microservices As opposed to Monolith, services do not share a database and all access must be done through a API exposed by the service. They may be in the same process (Monolith) or may be separated (Microservices). This reduces coupling.

Can be copied to disk to speed up recovery if a replica fails.
Best used for small data sets with infrequent updates that require high availability.
Limitations CRDT: Do not work with every data type that require a merge function. Some data types are too complex to merge and require the use of tombstone:
A marker that shows something was deleted.</description></item><item><title>Lightbend Academy</title><link>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base/uncategorized/lightbend-academy/</guid><description>Referred in
