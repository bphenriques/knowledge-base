As opposed to [[file:monolith.org][Monolith]], services do not share a database and all access must be done through a API exposed by the service. They may be in the same process ([[file:monolith.org][Monolith]]) or may be separated ([[file:microservices.org][Microservices]]). This reduces coupling.

E.g.:
- Orders -> RDBMS
- Customers -> No SQL
- Reservations -> Web Service
- Menu -> RDBMS
