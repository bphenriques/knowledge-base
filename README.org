* Digital Garden

My digital garden is available at [[https://bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base][bphenriques.github.io/knowledge-base]].

* How it works

The content is written using ~org-mode~ in the ~org~ directory where each ~*.org~ file is a new note.

Then, using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], each ~*.org~ file is converted to ~*.md~ which will feed ~gohugo~ to generate my digital garden.

* Run locally

1. Export existing ~*.org~ content and run the website locally:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   $ make clean build-content serve
   #+END_SRC
2. Open [[http://localhost:1313][localhost:1313]].

* Theme

I am no frontend engineer therefore it was challenging building this theme.

This theme was heavily based on [[https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book][Hugo Book Theme]] with a twist of [[https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes][Gatsby Theme Code Nodes]] and [[https://www.maggiedelano.com/garden/][Maggie Delano's digital garden]].
