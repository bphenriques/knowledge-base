#+TITLE: Random Memories

Curious ideas/sentences and what not from now and then. Some things are pretty obvious but worthwhile remembering (:

- Failure in systems are inevitable. We have to accept and build a system that isolates such failures in a way that becomes unnoticible to the end-user.
- User does not care whether the software was faulty due to a third-party vender or not. When we build software we have to consider third-party vendors and if we don't properly isolate ourselves from their faulty behavior, users are going to pay for that.


- Responsiveness builds user confidence.

- Domain: Sphere of knowledge that models either a business or an idea.
